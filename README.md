# AnatSearchlight
This repository includes code to run a searchlight analysis on functional MRI data using python. The pipeline includes two main steps: 1) define_searchlight.py: this script defines the searchlight sphere and saves the sphere indices in a .npy file?
2) run_searchlight.py: this script runs the searchlight analysis using the sphere indices and saves the results in .nii files. This step uses function.py to use predefined functions to calculate the searchlight results.

## Dependencies

- numpy
- nibabel
- nilearn
